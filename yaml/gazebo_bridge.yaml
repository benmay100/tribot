#How to build the bridges!
#1. Run your model in Gazebo, then run 'ros2 topic list' in the terminal
#2. You will now see the ROS topics your Gazebo model might want to publish to (e.g. joint_states) or subscribe to (e.g. cmd_vel)
#3. For each ROS topic you need to create a bridge for, now find its interface type using 'ros2 topic info /topic'
#4. Make note of both the topic and the interface type it uses
#5. Now use 'gz topic -l' in the terminal to get a list of the current Gazebo topics
#6. For each Gazebo topic you need to create a bridge for, now find its interface type using 'gz topic -i -t /topic'
#7. Again make note of the topics and the topic types you need to use...
#8. Now visit this page: https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/tree/ros2/ros_gz_bridge
#9. On this page you will find the corresponding gazebo topic type and ros topic type and here you can map them together!
